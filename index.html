    <h1>The <span>Roboman</span></h1>

      <p>Roboman is a name given to humans who were converted by the Daleks into obedient slaves during their invasion of Earth in the 22nd century. The Daleks operated on their brains and fitted them with helmet-like headsets that controlled their actions. The Robomen were armed with machine guns and used for patrols and overseeing other slaves. However, the Daleksâ€™ mind control technique was unstable and would eventually wear off, causing the Robomen to go insane and commit suicide.<p>
